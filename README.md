# I cant add this app on heroku so i tooked code from this app, fixed validations and deploy on heroku. I not deleted this part because this explain of creating this project.

- All navigation buttons work correctly
## Technologies Used
# 
- QT designer (https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download)
- Python
- Libraries
    - PYQT6 (https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)
    - pyowm (https://pypi.org/project/pyowm/)
    - time (built-in Python)

## Logic

- Download QTdesigner and create a design.After you recieve file.ui. You need to convert it to file.py for working.Use this command(python -m PyQt6.uic.pyuic -x file.ui -o file.py)
After you need to import main class from every file to your main(run.py).After this you can call action for every button in your main.
- Pyowm - library for recieve a weather. You need a registrate your account on webite of https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.After you recive your own key for use this pip :
owm = OWM("4383a10a783aec00988fb6992379ab92")
observation = mgr.weather_at_place(place) - this string give you cities and country and you can put this data where you want.

### Bugs
- First bug when you write a 'comment' for recieve after x minutes i cant share this data from first page to reminder window.

- Second bug validators for input data from user not working.If you will write city or country what not exist or something except numbers in timer you will broke this app.
It happen because in PYQT6 library working another rules for validators and i couldn't find it.
